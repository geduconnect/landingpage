        <button class="accordion">What is the meaning of Distance Education?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The exchange of knowledge between the learned and learner is normally facilitated by regular campus
                mode of education. However, in the distance mode of education technology vehicles bridge the gap
                between learned and learner, eliminating the geographical barrier between the two. The learner can
                login to the virtual classroom as per his/her convenience and comfort. The Vivekananda Global
                University offers UG and PG Programs through distance mode which are at par with the University
                campus Programs. The University offers these Programs through a learner friendly, robust, effective
                Learning Management System (LMS).</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is Vivekananda Global University a member of the Association of Indian
            Universities (AIU)?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, Vivekananda Global University is a member of the AIU.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is it compulsory to attend classes under distance education mode?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No, attending the class is not compulsory, the focus is strictly on the learning and its outcome
                while providing every possible learning support like – interactive, quality learning material,
                webinar, discussions Personal contact Programs, etc. The learners are free to use these facilities
                without any compulsions, however, course work is compulsory and no compromise in the evaluation and
                certification process.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is there a convocation at the end of the course?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Vivekananda Global University holds convocation once a year, the dates for which are decided by
                the University. The date of convocation will be notified on website.</p>

        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Is there a limit on the maximum period of time I have to finish a degree?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes. The maximum duration for completing any program is double the number of years of its normal
                duration.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What is Personal Contact Programme (PCP)?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The purpose of PCPs is to answer queries of learners and clarify their doubts that may not be
                possible through any other means of communication. It also provides with an opportunity to meet
                fellow students. Normally, these sessions will be held at the University Headquarter on Saturdays,
                Sundays, Holidays and during vacation of programmes in Regular Mode. The Objective of these sessions
                is to resolve subject-based difficulties and any other related problems. Before attending the PCP
                for each course, please go through your printed Self Learning material as per the session schedule
                and make a plan of the points to be discussed.</p>
